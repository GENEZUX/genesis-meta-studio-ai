### 2. Temenos AI  
- **Strengths:** Real-time decisioning, AI-driven journeys, embedded in banking platform  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Assumes business processes are already defined; no process discovery/design layer  
- **GTM Fit:** Banks needing operational agility; GMW11 pre-feeds Temenos with optimal process blueprints

### 3. MongoDB AI-Powered Modernization  
- **Strengths:** Automated refactoring, cloud migration, compliance tracking  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Pure technical; doesn't address business process redesign  
- **GTM Fit:** Technical teams; GMW11 bridges business + technical requirements

### 4. BUSINESSNEXT  
- **Strengths:** Customer 360, omnichannel, workflow automation, generative AI layers  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Customer-facing CRM; doesn't validate backend business process changes  
- **GTM Fit:** Banks needing customer engagement; GMW11 optimizes supporting backend processes

### 5. nCino  
- **Strengths:** Loan origination, AI-assisted processing, treasury, specific lending vertical expertise  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Vertical-specific; doesn't address cross-functional modernization  
- **GTM Fit:** Banks in lending; GMW11 can optimize lending process design *before* nCino implementation

### 6. Pega  
- **Strengths:** Visual modeling, low-code, regulatory compliance kits, real-time decisioning  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Execution platform; requires pre-defined process specs; no discovery/simulation  
- **GTM Fit:** Banks needing flexible process orchestration; GMW11 provides the validated specs

### 7. Scienaptic AI  
- **Strengths:** Predictive underwriting, non-traditional data analysis, transparent decisioning  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Niche AI for underwriting only; doesn't address broader modernization  
- **GTM Fit:** Underwriting teams; specialized, not horizontal

### 8. Zest AI  
- **Strengths:** Inclusive lending, auto lending AI, risk modeling with alternative data  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Lending-focused AI; limited to underwriting use case  
- **GTM Fit:** Auto/alternative lenders; not applicable to broader banking modernization

### 9. Stride 100x  
- **Strengths:** Deep code tracing, visualization, 87% faster .NET migrations, complex system expertise  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Code-centric; doesn't validate if modernization aligns with business process goals  
- **GTM Fit:** Banks with .NET monoliths; GMW11 can layer process validation on top

### 10. Open Legacy  
- **Strengths:** Automated API creation, dependency mapping, hybrid coexistence for mainframes  
- **Weakness vs. GMW11:** Integration layer only; doesn't address process redesign or validation  
- **GTM Fit:** Mainframe modernization; GMW11 adds business layer

## GMW11's Unique Positioning: "The Orchestrator"

### What GMW11 Does That Others Don't

1. **Discover & Map Phase**  
   - Extracts business logic from opaque legacy systems
   - Identifies pain points and inefficiencies
   - Creates visual "as-is" process maps
   - **Only GMW11 does this systematically**

2. **Design & Simulate Phase**  
   - Co-designs optimal "to-be" processes with business stakeholders
   - Generates interactive 3D process simulators
   - **No competitor offers 3D simulation for banking processes**
   - De-risks adoption before build starts

3. **Guide & Integrate Phase**  
   - Produces validated technical specifications
   - Acts as orchestrator for downstream tools (Temenos, Pega, nCino, MongoDB, etc.)
   - Bridges IT-Business goal misalignment
   - **Unique: Not a replacement for execution platforms, but their perfect feeder**

### Market Gap Addressed by GMW11

**The Problem:** Banks spend months/years on modernization projects that:
- Reduce technical debt but increase business disruption
- Upgrade systems without optimizing processes
- Suffer misalignment between IT and business goals
- Have no early proof of value before major CAPEX commitment

**GMW11 Solution:** Provides pre-implementation business process validation and optimization, turning modernization into a **series of confident, value-driven steps** rather than a high-risk technical bet.

## Recommended Go-to-Market Approach

### Partner, Don't Compete

**Phase 1: Discover & Map (Week 1-2)**
- Bank selects target legacy system (e.g., SME loan origination)
- GMW11 extracts logic, identifies pain points
- Deliverable: Visual as-is process map + business case

**Phase 2: Design & Simulate (Week 3-4)**
- GMW11 + bank co-design optimal process
- 3D simulator generated, stakeholders validate
- Deliverable: Validated to-be process + training materials

**Phase 3: Guide & Integrate (Week 5+)**
- Clear technical blueprint handed to implementation team
- Bank chooses executor: Temenos, Pega, nCino, MongoDB, etc.
- GMW11 ensures alignment through integration layer
- Deliverable: De-risked, business-validated modernization

### Pitch Template

> "We're not replacing your core banking platform or CRM. We're ensuring that when you modernize with [Temenos/Pega/nCino], you're modernizing the *right processes, in the right order, with business stakeholder buy-in.* That's what reduces modernization risk by 60-80%."

## Competitive Strengths Summary

| **Dimension** | **GMW11 Advantage** |
|---|---|
| **Timeline** | Delivers business value in 4 weeks, not 18 months |
| **Risk** | De-risks adoption through 3D simulation + stakeholder alignment |
| **Integration** | Orchestrates multiple downstream platforms (doesn't force lock-in) |
| **Business Focus** | Validates modernization against business outcomes, not just tech debt |
| **Proof of Value** | Tangible visual deliverables early (process maps, simulators, training) |

---

## Conclusion

GMW11 occupies a **blue ocean** in banking modernization: it's not a core platform, not a CRM, not a code refactoring tool, and not an underwriting AI. Instead, it's the **orchestrator layer** that ensures all these tools work toward actual business outcomes.

**The question banks should ask:** "Why should we modernize before we know *which* processes we're modernizing and *why?*"

**GMW11's answer:** "Because we'll show you—in 3D, with your stakeholders—before you spend a dime on implementation."
